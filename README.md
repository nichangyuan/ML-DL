**Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). 

**The non-learning types of AI** include rule based algorithms (imagine an extremely complex series of if/else blocks); heuristic based AIs such as A* search; constraint satisfaction algorithms like Arc Consistency; tree search algorithms such as minimax (used by the famous Deep Blue chess AI); and more.

**Machine learning** algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machines, and decision trees all “learn” in different ways, but fundamentally they all apply this same process: make a prediction, receive a correction, and adjust the prediction mechanism based on the correction. At a high level, it’s quite similar to how a human learns.

**Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning which focuses on a specific category of machine learning algorithms called ***neural networks***. Neural networks were originally inspired by the way human brains work — individual “neurons” receive “signals” from other neurons and in turn send “signals” to other “neurons”. Each neuron transforms the incoming “signals” in some way, and eventually an output signal is produced. If everything went well that signal represents a correct prediction!

This is a helpful mental model, but computers are not biological brains. Researchers and scientists instead use graph theory to model neural networks — instead of describing neural networks as “artificial brains”, they describe them as ***complex graphs*** with powerful properties. Viewed through the lens of graph theory a neural network is a series of layers of connected nodes; each node represents a “neuron” and each connection represents a “synapse”.

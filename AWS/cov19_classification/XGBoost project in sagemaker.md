This is a classification project of COVID-19 data from kaggle.com

I downloaded data (version 6 - 19-5-20.csv) from kaggle.com, then worked on 
1. Pre-model Analysis: process and visualize data; get insights of features and target.
2. Problem Definition: translate the business needs into machine learning problems; design metrics to measure model performance.
3. Feature Engineering: create features which might improve model performance.
4. Modeling: Model selection, feature elimination, validation, hyperparameter tuning.

lr_ANN: Applying artificial neural networks (ANNs) for linear regression
ANN-exercise01.ipynb: Use Keras to build a network with a single /multiple hidden layer(s); final model should have better than 92% accuracy on validation and test data.
ANN-exercise02.ipynb: Experiment with activation, loss, optimizers, and regularization; build at least two neural networks that achieve 97% or better validation accuracy on the MNIST dataset without using convolutional layers.

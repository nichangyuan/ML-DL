1. **lr_ANN.ipynb**: Applying artificial neural networks (ANNs) for linear regression.<br>
2. **ANN-exercise01.ipynb**: Use Keras to build a network with a single /multiple hidden layer(s); final model should have better than 92% accuracy on validation and test data.<br>
3. **ANN-exercise02.ipynb**: Experiment with activation, loss, optimizers, and regularization; build at least two neural networks that achieve 97% or better validation accuracy on the MNIST dataset without using convolutional layers. <br>

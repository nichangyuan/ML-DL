This is a model built for people interested in jobs in Data Science field. Usually, jobs in this field are in 3 categories: Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist. However, each company can name their jobs very differently, like some people working on data cleaning are also titled Data Scientist. Here, ***Data Scientist means those people working on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, and Statistical Modeling***. 
- You can put part of your resume to the text field to check which job category fits your skills most. For example, I paste *Summary* and *Skills* from my resume, respectively, and the results show "**DATA SCIENTIST** with a probability of 100.0%", so is it when I paste all my resume there.
- You can search jobs in any job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, then copy and paste the job description to the text field.
